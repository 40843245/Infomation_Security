In this article, I will talk about the core elements of information security.

-----------------------------------------
If a system is safe, it must satisfy these requirements.
(1.1)Confidentiality:
The sensitive data must NOT be hijiacked easily by anyone which unrelated to the system.
These items will affect the scability of a safe system.
Data encryption while transfer or not.

(1.2)Integrity:
Data can NOT be modified after sending.

(1.3)Availability:
Anyone who is granted with access privilege can access the data.

(1.4)Non-repudation:
Must commit the data is transferred after transferring.

(1.5)Authentication:
Can identify the user.

(1.6)Authority:
Determine access control for anyone appropriately.
It is NOT allowed to grant a user a big access control (making the user can easily access the data in the system.)
